## Synopsis

This is our entry for the Godot Wild Jam #17! [Play it here!](https://animerrill.itch.io/metempsychosis)

### Life insurance

Your entire living species has been wiped out. Fortunately, they have taken up an insurance with Second Chance Inc., an AI-controlled company located on an ancient space ship in a remote corner of the universe.

On board the space ship, they preserve specimens of every known species (as long as they remember to pay their insurance fees). You are one of these specimens, and Second Chance Inc. is given you the opportunity to restart your population.

However, you first have to prove that this rebirth will not fail as a result of the same weakness that destroyed you in the first place.

### Communication is key(s)

The recommended way to play this game is with a friend. Open your favourite chat program between you two and each start the game. The game does not require an internet connection, so feel free to use postal mail, telegrams, or pigeons (though it might slow you down a bit).

If no friends are available (or worse: drop out halfway), there is a friendly chatbot built into the game who can take up this role. But it won't be as fun. We're just saying.

We recommend using headphones while playing this game for the best experience.

We are glad the people who played it so far had a great time with it! We just released our first post jam update (to complete an HTML version that works on both mobile and desktop) and we hope to put out updates throughout the year to finish the original scope we had in mind.

Thanks to everyone who encouraged us~!
